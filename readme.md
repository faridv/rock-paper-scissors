# Rock-Paper-Scissors game

This project has been meticulously crafted to meet the specifications outlined in the assignment while staying true to its title and purpose.

I have used ES modules to simplify the project and make it more readable.
It also doesn't need any external libraries. You can serve the project folder on a web server and play the game in a modern browser.

This project is designed for simplicity and ease of use. It requires no installation, dependencies, or tests, making it a hassle-free experience.

I used CSS because a preprocessor requires an external library to build an output file. The CSS file is small and can be easily converted to SCSS or similar.

## Rules
* Paper wins the rock but loses to scissors.
* Scissors win the paper but lose to rock.
* Rock wins the scissors but loses to paper.
* It is possible to change or extend the rules in the future.

## Features
* Players can choose their names.
* You can play with a computer or a real person in the same window.
* You can save your game and get back to it later.
* Each time you save the game, it overwrites the previous one.
* You can reset the game and start a new one.

### Future Improvements

If I had more time, there would be many things to add to the project.
For example, saved game data can easily be manipulated by users.
The best approach is to store the game data in a database and use a Rest API.

Given the short time required to complete this project, I could only implement the browser version of the game.

I didn't use any frameworks, libraries, etc., because the instructions didn't mention any.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
